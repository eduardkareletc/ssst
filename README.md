# SSST

A simple static site tool to maintain websites based on markdown and pandoc

# Dependencies

- pandoc
- pdf2svg
- python3
- pyyaml

# Requirements

- summaries of first few posts on home page
- support tags/keywords (keywords: in YAML), categories (categories: in YAML)
  - below posts
  - pages with links to posts belonging to that tag or category
- date of publication auto-generated
- support LaTeX math (as SVG graphics): latex (standalone package) -> pdf2svg
- support comments (email)
  - comment written in markdown
  - includes name of person submitting comment (derived from from address)
  - includes date of submitting comment
  - show number of comments on summary home page
- support search (startpage site:xot.nl $searchterm)
- statistics

# Input (relative to the INPUT directory)

- input pages stored in folders with the following structure
  ./<optional path>/title.md
- input posts stored in folders with following structure
  ./yyyy/mm/dd/title/index.md
  make sure the date inside the post is correct
- new comment is added in appropriate folder
  ./yyyy/mm/dd/title/comment.x.y.mdc
  where x.y... is the comment numbering scheme: .1 is first main comment, .2 second main comment, ... .x.y is the y-th response to the x-th main comment.
- media stored with post/page in same directory are copied to the output tree 
  (i.e files with extension .jpg, .gif, .pdf and .png)
  keeping their metadata (i.e modification times)
  
# Generated input

Based on the posts in the input tree, the following additional input is generated (all in markdown format, but with extension `.sst` to indicate they
are generated by SSST and should not be treated like orginal posts)

- monthly archives in `./yyyy/mm/index.sst`
- a list of all monthly archives in `./archives.sst`
- category files listing all posts with a certain category in `./category/<categorystring>/index.sst`
- tag files listing all posts with a certain tag in `./tag/<tagstring>/index.sst`

Care is taken to only overwrite these files (and change its modification time) if their content actually changes (to ensure that the corresponding HTML output file is only (re)generated when necessary.

# Output (relative to the OUTPUT directory)

- posts:
  ./yyyy/mm/dd/title/ -> redirects to index.html 
  index.html contains main content and all comments
  all media referenced (and equations generated) stored/copied to ./yyyy/mm/dd/
  - posts point to next/previous post
- pages (essentially undated posts):
  ./<optional path>/title/ -> redirects to index.html 
  index.html contains main content and all comments
  all media referenced (and equations generated) stored/copied to ./yyyy/mm/dd/
- style sheet
- tag pages automatically generated and stored in
  ./tag/<tag>/ -> redirect to index.html in this folder
  list will all posts tagged, in chronological order
- category pages automatically generated and stored in
  ./category/<category>/ -> redirect to index.html in this folder
  list will all chategories tagged, in chronological order
- monthly archives automatically generated and stored in
  ./yyyy/mm/ -> redirects to index.html
  (this could be summaries, as on main home page)
  - archive pages point to next/previous (avialable) month
- home page
  ./ -> redirects to index.html
  contains a summary of the five most recent posts

# Adding post to site (ssst-post.py)

- determine date; derive path
- determine last post; add prev-post link to YAML preamble of post to be added
- add next-post link to YAML preamble of previously last post
- add post.md to the input tree


# Adding comment to site (ssst-comment.py)

- comment received as email
  - subject: contains path to parent post/comment
  - from: contains author
  - date: contains date
  - body: contains comment as markdown
- reply with moderation status
- if accepted, feed email to ssst-comment.py
  - check that parent exists; fail if not
  - get author name from From:
  - get date from Date:
  - sanitise body
  - determine index as child
  - save comment as markdown


# Updating the site (ssst.py)

1. Determine which posts and pages need to be (re)made
   - when index.md changed
   - when comments added 
   => i.e. if output html in output tree is older than any one of these files, or does not exist

Force remake of all pages to (re)create datastructures 
- create prev/next post information from YAML preamble
- archives
- tag/category pages
- home page

2. For every post that needs to be (re)made
    - determine the number of comments, update YAML preamble post.md 
    - convert each comment to html (templates/ssst-comment.html)
    - convert main post to html (templates/ssst-post.html)
      - including comments (use pandoc --include-after / -A)
	  - (remove html versions of comments when done; or rather, do everything safely in a temp directory)
    - convert equations to svg (templates/ssst-eq.tex)
    - update tag pages, when necessary
    - update category pages, when necessary
	- update monthly archives, when neccessary
    - update summary page, when necessary (template ssst-summary.html)
	  - only one main summary page; "older entries" points to archive
	  
3. For every page that needs to be (re)made
    - do essentially the same as above (except ignoring dates)
    - convert page to html (template ssst-page.html)
